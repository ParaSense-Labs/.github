## 🎯 About

ParaSense Labs is an open-source initiative dedicated to bringing **scientific rigor** to paranormal research. We design, build, and share tools that enable anyone to conduct evidence-based investigations of unexplained phenomena.

### Our Mission

To democratize paranormal research by providing:
- 🔓 **Open hardware designs** - Accessible to makers and researchers worldwide
- 📊 **Transparent methodology** - Reproducible experiments and clear documentation
- 🧪 **Scientific approach** - Statistical validation, baseline correction, and controlled testing
- 🌍 **Community-driven development** - Collaborative improvement through peer review

### Core Values
```
🔬 Scientific Integrity  →  Evidence over belief
🤝 Open Collaboration   →  Shared knowledge benefits everyone
🎓 Education           →  Teaching scientific methodology
💡 Innovation          →  Pushing technological boundaries
```

## 🧪 Scientific Approach

### How We Maintain Rigor

✅ **Control for false positives**
- Background EMF mapping
- Temperature/humidity correlation
- Mechanical vibration detection
- Power supply noise filtering

✅ **Reproducible results**
- Timestamped raw data
- GPS location tagging
- Environmental condition logging
- Open-source analysis code

✅ **Transparent limitations**
- Known sensor sensitivities
- Range and accuracy specifications
- Sources of interference
- Interpretation boundaries

> *"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."* - Carl Sagan
> 
> We're building the tools to gather it.
